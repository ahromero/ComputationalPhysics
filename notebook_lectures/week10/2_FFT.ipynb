This gives you an idea of how the algorithm grows with the size of the problem - it says nothing about the overall time. Hopefully, overall speed is optimal for an algorithm; maybe we are using Numba or something like that; but even if you are not, the order still holds between similar implementations. The order really describes the number of operations an algorithm requires, but that should be related to the time."

This means for $N=1,000$ elements, you would need $1,000,000$ calculations (where \"calculations\" has an unspecified size). FFTs are order $\\mathcal{O}(N \\log_2 N)$ instead. So, since $1024 = 2^{10}$, this is roughly $1000\\times 10 = 10,000$ calculations - that's 100 times faster.
