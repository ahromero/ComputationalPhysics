    "* TKinter: Old, built into Python. Not pythonic, limited in scope, ugly, and a bit slow. Better with a wrapper.\n",
    "    * [PySimpleGUI](https://github.com/MikeTheWatchGuy/PySimpleGUI): Designed to be both simple and powerful. Very new, but very promising for simple to mid-level GUIs. A new PySimpleGUI_Qt front end \n",
    "* Qt: Industrial grade GUI toolkit for C++. Has two Python bindings.\n",
    "    * PyQT: Powerful, GPL only bindings. First to support Qt5 and Python 3.\n",
    "    * PySide: Acquired by Qt, to become the \"official\" bindings. Old, still Qt4.\n",
    "    * [Qt for Python](https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python) (PySide 2): Soon to become the first \"official\" release of PySide under Qt\n",
    "* [wxPython](https://wxpython.org): A framework built for Python.\n",
    "* [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/news): A OpenGL gui made for games. Waiting on a big 2.0 release.\n",
    "* [kivy](https://kivy.org): Some fancy cross platform thing, but not easy to install/integrate as far as I can tell.\n",
